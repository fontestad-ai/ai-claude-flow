```

### 3.2 Hook Handlers

```

### 3.3 Data Augmentation Strategy

```javascript
// Historical Pattern Augmentation

## 4. PATTERN STORAGE & RETRIEVAL

**Files**:
- `/home/user/ai-claude-flow/src/services/agentic-flow-hooks/types.ts`
- `/home/user/ai-claude-flow/src/neural/NeuralDomainMapper.ts`

### 4.1 Pattern Store Interface

```typescript
interface Pattern {
  id: string;
  type: 'success' | 'failure' | 'optimization' | 'behavior';
  confidence: number;           // 0-1 confidence score
  occurrences: number;          // frequency count
  context: Record<string, any>; // metadata
}

interface PatternStore {
  add(pattern: Pattern): void;
  get(id: string): Pattern | undefined;
  findSimilar(pattern: Partial<Pattern>, threshold: number): Pattern[];
  getByType(type: Pattern['type']): Pattern[];
  prune(maxAge: number): void;
  export(): Pattern[];
  import(patterns: Pattern[]): void;
}
```

### 4.2 Pattern Matching & Retrieval

```
PATTERN MATCHING ALGORITHM:
1. Similarity Calculation
   - Type matching: 0.3 weight
   - Confidence proximity: 1 - |p1.confidence - p2.confidence|
   - Context overlap: keyword matching in context
   
2. Threshold-Based Filtering
   - Similarity >= threshold (default 0.7)
   - Confidence >= min threshold (default 0.5)
   - Type matching preferred

3. Ranking & Selection
   - Sort by similarity score
   - Prioritize high-confidence patterns
   - Consider occurrence frequency
```

### 4.3 Pattern Lifecycle

```
CREATE
  ↓
DETECT (confidence >= 0.7)
  ↓
STORE (permanent or TTL-based)
  ↓
RETRIEVE (on-demand or periodic)
  ↓
APPLY (to new contexts)
  ↓
VALIDATE (check if improved outcome)
  ↓
UPDATE CONFIDENCE & OCCURRENCES
  ↓
PRUNE (old patterns, max age)
```

## 7. DOMAIN ANALYSIS & OPTIMIZATION

**File**: `/home/user/ai-claude-flow/src/neural/NeuralDomainMapper.ts`

### 7.1 Domain Cohesion Analysis

```
COHESION CALCULATION:
Overall Score = (Structural + Functional + Behavioral + Semantic) / 4

Structural Cohesion (0-1):
- Connectivity analysis
- Edge weight consideration
- Graph connectivity ratio
- Formula: (connectivity + weightedConnectivity) / 2

Functional Cohesion (0-1):
- Domain purpose alignment
- Type similarity (same type domains = better)
- Complexity alignment
- Formula: (sameTypePenalty × 0.6) + (complexityAlignment × 0.4)

Behavioral Cohesion (0-1):
- Interaction pattern frequency
- Reliability of interactions
- Latency metrics
- Formula: (frequencyScore + reliabilityScore + latencyScore) / 3

Semantic Cohesion (0-1):
- Name similarity analysis
- Type matching
- Metadata alignment
- Formula: average(nameSimilarity + typeSimilarity) across connected domains

Weak Points Identification (score < 0.6):
- Flag low-scoring domains
- Identify problematic cohesion factors
- Generate improvement suggestions
```

### 7.2 Cross-Domain Dependency Analysis

```
DEPENDENCY DETECTION:
1. Build dependency graph
   - For each domain, find dependencies
   - Filter edges by type = 'dependency'
   
2. Detect circular dependencies
   - Use DFS with recursion stack
   - Find cycles of length >= 2
   
3. Identify critical paths
   - Find dependency chains > 3 domains
   - Calculate risk (1 - reliability)
   - Calculate impact (affected domains / total)
   - Select top 10 by (risk + impact)
   
4. Calculate metrics
   - Average in-degree: avg incoming edges
   - Average out-degree: avg outgoing edges
   - Maximum depth: longest dependency chain
   - Cyclomatic complexity: edges - nodes + 2

CRITICAL PATH PRIORITIZATION:
Sort by: (risk × 0.6) + (impact × 0.4)
Select: Top 10 paths requiring attention
```

### 7.3 Boundary Optimization Proposals

```
PROPOSAL TYPES:
1. Merge: Combine highly coupled domains
   - Cohesion improvement: combine cohesion scores
   - Coupling reduction: eliminate cross-domain edges
   
2. Split: Break low-cohesion domains
   - Identify functional groups
   - Propose new boundary
   - Estimate cohesion improvement
   
3. Relocate: Move functionality between domains
   - Find misplaced components
   - Suggest target domain
   - Calculate improvement metrics
   
4. Abstract: Extract common patterns
   - Find repeated patterns
   - Propose abstraction layer
   - Estimate reusability

OPTIMIZATION SCORE: 0-1
Formula: sum(proposal.confidence × 0.1 for all proposals)
Maximum: bounded at 1.0

PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT:
- Critical: cohesion < 0.3
- High: optimization score > 0.7
- Medium: optimization score > 0.4
- Low: optimization score <= 0.4

```
1. OPERATION EXECUTION
   └─ Execute agent task → Success

2. HOOK TRIGGERS
   ├─ Pre-operation hooks (setup)
   ├─ Operation execution
   └─ Post-operation hooks (learning)

3. PATTERN EXTRACTION
   ├─ Analyze operation inputs
   ├─ Analyze operation outputs
   ├─ Calculate success metrics
   └─ Create pattern object
       {
         id: "pattern-123",
         type: "success",
         confidence: 0.75,
         occurrences: 1,
         context: { input, output, metrics, timestamp }
       }

4. PATTERN STORE UPDATE
   ├─ Add to pattern store
   ├─ Generate 1024-dim embedding
   ├─ Index for similarity search
   └─ Cache for fast retrieval

5. TRAINING DATA ASSEMBLY
   ├─ Retrieve recent successful patterns (50 most recent)
   ├─ Augment with historical successful patterns
   ├─ Balance dataset by pattern type
   ├─ Preprocess/normalize inputs
   └─ Package as TrainingData

6. MODEL TRAINING
   ├─ Batch size: 32 samples
   ├─ For each epoch (max 100):
   │  ├─ Shuffle training data
   │  ├─ Process batches:
   │  │  ├─ Forward pass through 3 GNN layers
   │  │  ├─ Calculate MSE loss
   │  │  ├─ Backward pass (backpropagation)
   │  │  ├─ Update weights via Adam optimizer
   │  │  └─ Update learning rate (decay every 20 epochs)
   │  ├─ Validate on 20% hold-out set
   │  └─ Check early stopping criteria (patience=10, minDelta=0.001)
   └─ Return best model (restore best weights)

7. VALIDATION & STORAGE
   ├─ Calculate final accuracy
   ├─ Check promotion criteria (avg > 0.85)
   ├─ If promoted:
   │  ├─ Store as primary model
   │  ├─ Archive old version
   │  └─ Emit promotion event
   └─ Store training history in memory

8. CONTINUOUS MONITORING
   ├─ Track confidence evolution
   ├─ Monitor pattern occurrences
   ├─ Detect pattern combinations
   └─ Trigger adaptations if needed

## 13. SECURITY & SAFETY MECHANISMS

### 13.1 Pattern Confidence Thresholds

```
Application Logic:
- confidence >= 0.9: Expert recommendation (high trust)
- confidence >= 0.75: Suggested (medium trust)
- confidence >= 0.5: Consider (low confidence, validate)
- confidence < 0.5: Ignore (insufficient data)

Adaptation Safety:
- Parameter changes: Validated before application
- Architecture changes: Require confidence > 0.8
- Strategy changes: Require confidence > 0.75 AND impact < 0.5
- Large changes: Require additional epoch count > 10
```

### 13.2 Validation Mechanisms

```
Data Validation:
- Check inputs/outputs exist
- Check batch size > 0
- Check epochs > 0
- Check equal input/output lengths
- Prevent NaN/Infinity values

Model Safety:
- Gradient clipping (prevent exploding gradients)
- Weight regularization (L1, L2)
- Dropout for robustness
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Model checkpoints for rollback
```

## 16. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES

### 16.1 Adaptation Mechanisms

```
Parameter Adaptation:
- Learning rate: Decayed by 0.9 every 20 epochs
- Batch size: Increased for better stability (8→64)
- Dropout: Increased for overfitting (0.1→0.2)
- Regularization: L2 weight increased for large datasets

Architecture Adaptation:
- Add layers: If model underfitting
- Remove layers: If overfitting
- Change layer size: If bottleneck detected
- Adjust attention heads: For transformer models

Strategy Adaptation:
- Optimizer switch: Adam → AdamW for large-scale
- Loss function: MSE → Cross-entropy for classification
- Batch normalization: Add for stability
- Layer normalization: For transformer layers
```

### 16.2 Meta-Learning

```
Learning How to Learn:
1. Track which adaptations improve accuracy
2. Store successful adaptation sequences
3. Apply similar sequences to new models
4. Extract meta-patterns (e.g., "increase dropout when...")
5. Build optimization strategy library
6. Reuse strategies for faster convergence
```

## 17. COMPARISON: NEURAL VS TRADITIONAL APPROACHES

### Performance Gains

```
Traditional Approach:
- Hardcoded patterns: Fixed, not adaptive
- Manual optimization: Requires domain expert
- One-size-fits-all: Not context-aware
- Slow iteration: Days to test changes
- Limited learning: No continuous improvement

Neural Pattern Approach:
- Learned patterns: Adaptive, context-aware
- Automatic optimization: Via hook system
- Domain-specific: Generated per domain
- Fast iteration: Real-time feedback loop
- Continuous learning: Improves with usage
- 2.8-4.4x faster execution (with patterns)
- 32.3% fewer tokens needed
- 84.8% task completion rate
```
